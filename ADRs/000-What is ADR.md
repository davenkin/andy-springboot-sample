An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

For each ADR, please write a separate file in the `ADRs` directory, using the format `000-What-is-ADR.md`, where `000` is a sequential number that indicates the order of the ADRs.

When writing an ADR file, please follow the below content templates:

# Title[Change to the actual title of the ADR, eg "Choose the database"]

## Context

Why a decision is needed?

## Decision

What is the decision and why we choose it?

## Implementation

This section is optional. It documents the details of how to implement the chosen decision. It should provide enough information for new team members to quickly understand and adopt the decision, best with code examples.
